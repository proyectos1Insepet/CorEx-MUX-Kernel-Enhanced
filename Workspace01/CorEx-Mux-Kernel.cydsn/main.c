****** GLOBAL CONVENTIONS ****** 

- Global variables (those that have no parent "module") are preceded by an underscore "_"
- Global constants are preceded by an underscore "_" and defined in UPPERCASE as a RULE
- MACROS are some preceded by an underscore "_" and others don't. They are as a RULE defined in UPPERCASE
- Global variables and types are prefixed with "_g_" to imply that are "Global"

There is a global loop handler that invokes all of the handled methods in the order they where pushed 
onto the Loop Queue. Take this into account in order to avoid weird behaviors.

As an example on how to push a method that will be running in the loop, one would make the following call:

GLOBAL_LOOP_PUSH(YourMethodName);

Include the header file "globaldefinitions.h" to get access to this macro.

The preferred place to push your method is during the initialization phase, so put the initialization call
in the desired order according to the loop invocation order.
